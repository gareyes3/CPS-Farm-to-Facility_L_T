# Farm to Facility Process Model
	This is a Process model for leafy greens created by the Stasiewicz Lab at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 

## Goal
	The goal of this model is to assess the effect of test-and-reject sampling plans in the context of differenr process systems. 

## How to Use
	The main repository contains a word document with intruction on the basic use of the model. "Model Files Explanation.doc"

## Raw model data
	The raw model data for all scenarios is contained will be shared upon request as it is too large to post in github.. The data "Combined Data 147 Scenarios.spydata" contains the data for all 147 scenarios. Use the file MarginalGains_Baseline.py to obtain the results. 
	The already processed csv files are found in the outer folder title CSV Files for Plots. Use the "Final Plots in R" Scrcipt to reproduce the plots from the already processed data. 

## Summary Excel Files

	The main repository file contains a summary excel file for the relative efficact data and the power data. Use this to reference the figures in the paper and the supplemental materials.
