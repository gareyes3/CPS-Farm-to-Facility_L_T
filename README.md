# Tomato Farm to Packinhouse Process Model
	This is a Process model for Tomatoes created by the Stasiewicz Lab at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 

## Goal
	The goal of this model is to assess the best sampling-testing plan and process stage combinations for tomatoes (Outputs are power and relative efficacy)

## How to Use
	The main model files are inside the "Model" Folder
		- Final_Analysis.py: Contains the analyses presented in the Manuscript
		- Funz.T.py: Contain the functions used to run the model
		- MainModel.py: Contains the process model (collect outputs and links functions togeter)
		- Scen_T: Used to select optional model inputs
		- DepInputz: Other input file that runs specific dependent inputsz
		-Inputz_T: Contains inputs for the model that are randomized for each run
		-Dictionariez_T: Creates dataframes for outputs collection as the main model runs. 

## Raw model data
	-Located in the Spydata to Produce Model Outputs folder - This contains the output data that is produce from running Final_Analysis.py
	-Data tomato Outputs: Contains the CSV files that the Final Analysis.py produces

## Summary Excel Files

	The main repository file contains a summary excel file for the relative efficact data and the power data. These documents contain the data that is reflected in the manuscript
	
## Parametrization
	Document containing related references used to parametrize the model.
